## Usage

### Location Services
The component now automatically requests location when adding a new address and uses the device's native GPS for accurate positioning. The geocoding service attempts to auto-fill city, state, and PIN code based on coordinates.

### Form Validation
- Phone numbers are validated for Indian mobile number formats (10 digits starting with 6-9)
- PIN codes must be exactly 6 digits
- All required fields have visual validation feedback

### Address Management
- Default address is clearly marked with badges
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
- Toast notifications provide feedback for all actions
- Pull-to-refresh allows users to refresh the address list

## Browser vs Native
- **Web**: Uses Ionic web components with web geolocation fallback
- **Mobile**: Uses native Capacitor plugins for optimal performance and permissions
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all screen sizes

## Future Enhancements
- Map integration for address selection
- Address validation service
- Bulk address import
- Address sharing functionality
- Offline address caching
